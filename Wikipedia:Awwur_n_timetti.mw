== Request for comment on Commons: Should Wikimedia support MP4 video? ==

''I apologize for this message being only in English. Please translate it if needed to help your community.''

The Wikimedia Foundation's [[mw:Multimedia|multimedia team]] seeks community guidance on a proposal to support the [[w:MP4|MP4 video format]]. This digital video standard is used widely around the world to record, edit and watch videos on mobile phones, desktop computers and home video devices. It is also known as [[w:MP4|H.264/MPEG-4 or AVC]].

Supporting the MP4 format would make it much easier for our users to view and contribute video on Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects -- and video files could be offered in dual formats on our sites, so we could continue to support current open formats (WebM and Ogg Theora). 

However, MP4 is a patent-encumbered format, and using a proprietary format would be a departure from our current practice of only supporting open formats on our sites -- even though the licenses appear to have acceptable legal terms, with only a small fee required. 

We would appreciate your guidance on whether or not to support MP4. Our Request for Comments presents views both in favor and against MP4 support, based on opinions we’ve heard in our discussions with community and team members. 

[[commons:Commons:Requests for comment/MP4 Video|Please join this RfC -- and share your advice]].

All users are welcome to participate, whether you are active on Commons, Wikipedia, other Wikimedia project -- or any site that uses content from our free media repository.

You are also welcome to join tomorrow's [[m:IRC_office_hours#Upcoming_office_hours|Office hours chat on IRC]],  this Thursday, January 16, at 19:00 UTC, if you would like to discuss this project with our team and other community members.

We look forward to a constructive discussion with you, so we can make a more informed decision together on this important topic. [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 06:46, 16 yennayer 2014 (UTC)

== Universal Language Selector will be enabled by default again on this wiki by 21 February 2014 ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
On January 21 2014 the MediaWiki extension [[mw:Universal Language Selector|Universal Language Selector]] (ULS) was [[mw:Universal Language Selector/Announcement Jan2014|disabled]] on this wiki. A new preference was added for logged-in users to turn on ULS. This was done to prevent slow loading of pages due to ULS webfonts, a behaviour that had been observed by the Wikimedia Technical Operations team on some wikis. 

We are now ready to enable ULS again. The temporary preference to enable ULS will be removed. A [[commons:File:ULS-font-checkbox.png|new checkbox]] has been added to the Language Panel to enable/disable font delivery. This will be unchecked by default for this wiki, but can be selected at any time by the users to enable webfonts. This is an interim solution while we improve the feature of webfonts delivery.

You can read the [[mw:Universal Language Selector/Announcement Feb2014|announcement]] and the [[mw:Universal Language Selector/Upcoming Development Plan|development plan]] for more information. Apologies for writing this message only in English. Thank you. [[m:User_talk:Runab WMF|Runa]]

== Changes to the default site typography coming soon ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"> 
This week, the typography on Wikimedia sites will be updated for all readers and editors who use the default "Vector" skin. This change will involve new serif fonts for some headings, small tweaks to body content fonts, text size, text color, and spacing between elements. The schedule is: 

* '''April 1st''': non-Wikipedia projects will see this change live
* '''April 3rd''': Wikipedias will see this change live

This change is very similar to the "Typography Update" Beta Feature that has been available on Wikimedia projects since November 2013. After several rounds of testing and with feedback from the community, this Beta Feature will be disabled and successful aspects enabled in the default site appearance. Users who are logged in may still choose to use another skin, or alter their [[Special:MyPage/vector.css|personal CSS]], if they prefer a different appearance. Local [[MediaWiki:Common.css|common CSS]] styles will also apply as normal, for issues with local styles and scripts that impact all users. 

For more information:

* [[mw:Talk:Typography refresh|Discussion page]] for feedback or questions

I wanted to let you know that [[mw:Multimedia/About Media Viewer|Media Viewer]] will be released to this wiki in the coming weeks.

== Media Viewer is now live on this wiki ==

<br>
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
[[File:Media_Viewer_Desktop_-_Large_Image_Opaque_Info.png|thumb|Media Viewer lets you see images in larger size]]

Greetings— and sorry for writing in English, please translate if it will help your community,

The Wikimedia Foundation's [[mw:Multimedia|Multimedia team]] is happy to announce that [[mw:Multimedia/About Media Viewer|Media Viewer]] was just released on this site today. 

Media Viewer displays images in larger size when you click on their thumbnails, to provide a better viewing experience. Users can now view images faster and more clearly, without having to jump to separate pages — and its user interface is more intuitive, offering easy access to full-resolution images and information, with links to the file repository for editing. The tool has been tested extensively across all Wikimedia wikis over the past six months as a [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|Beta Feature]] and has been [[mw:Multimedia/Media_Viewer/Release_Plan#Timeline|released]] to the largest Wikipedias, all language Wikisources, and the English Wikivoyage already.

If you do not like this feature, you can easily turn it off by clicking on "Disable Media Viewer" at the bottom of the screen, pulling up the information panel (or in your [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering|your preferences]]) whether you have an account or not. Learn more [[mw:Help:Multimedia/Media_Viewer#How_can_I_turn_off_this_feature.3F|in this Media Viewer Help page]].

Please let us know if you have any questions or comments about Media Viewer. You are invited to [[mw:Talk:Multimedia/About_Media_Viewer|share your feedback in this discussion on MediaWiki.org]] in any language, to help improve this feature. You are also welcome to [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/media-viewer-1-all?c=announce-all take this quick survey in English], [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/media-viewer-1-fr en français], [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/media-viewer-1-es o español].

We hope you enjoy Media Viewer. Many thanks to all the community members who helped make it possible. - [[mw:User:Fabrice Florin (WMF)|Fabrice Florin (WMF)]]  ([[m:User talk:Fabrice Florin (WMF)|talk]]) 21:54, 19 yunyu 2014 (UTC)

== Letter petitioning WMF to reverse recent decisions ==

The Wikimedia Foundation recently created a new feature, "superprotect" status. The purpose is to prevent pages from being edited by elected administrators -- but permitting WMF staff to edit them. It has been put to use in only one case: to protect the deployment of the Media Viewer software on German Wikipedia, in defiance of a clear decision of that community to disable the feature by default, unless users decide to enable it.

If you oppose these actions, please add your name to this letter. If you know non-Wikimedians who support our vision for the free sharing of knowledge, and would like to add their names to the list, please ask them to sign an identical version of the letter on change.org.

== Meta RfCs on two new global groups ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">Hello all, 

There are currently requests for comment open on meta to create two new global groups. The first is a group for members of the OTRS permissions queue, which would grant them autopatrolled rights on all wikis except those who opt-out. That proposal can be found at [[m:Requests for comment/Creation of a global OTRS-permissions user group]]. The second is a group for Wikimedia Commons admins and OTRS agents to view deleted file pages through the 'viewdeletedfile' right on all wikis except those who opt-out. The second proposal can be found at [[m:Requests for comment/Global file deletion review]].

We would like to hear what you think on both proposals. Both are in English; if you wanted to translate them into your native language that would also be appreciated.

It is possible for individual projects to opt-out, so that users in those groups do not have any additional rights on those projects. To do this please start a local discussion, and if there is consensus you can request to opt-out of either or both at [[m:Stewards' noticeboard]].

== Global AbuseFilter ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">Hello,

[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:AbuseFilter|AbuseFilter]] is a MediaWiki extension used to detect likely abusive behavior patterns, like pattern vandalism and spam. In 2013, [[m:Special:Mylanguage/Global AbuseFilter|Global AbuseFilters]] were enabled on a limited set of wikis including Meta-Wiki, MediaWiki.org, Wikispecies and (in early 2014) all the "[https://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/highlight.php?file=small.dblist small wikis]". Recently, global abuse filters were enabled on "[https://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/highlight.php?file=medium.dblist medium sized wikis]" as well. These filters are currently managed by stewards on Meta-Wiki and have shown to be very effective in preventing mass spam attacks across Wikimedia projects. However, there is currently no policy on how the global AbuseFilters will be managed although there are proposals. There is an ongoing [[m:Requests for comment/Global AbuseFilter|request for comment]] on policy governing the use of the global AbuseFilters. In the meantime, specific wikis can opt out of using the global AbuseFilter. These wikis can simply add a request to [[m:Global AbuseFilter/Opt-out wikis|this list]] on Meta-Wiki. More details can be found on [[m:Special:Mylanguage/Global AbuseFilter/2014 announcement|this page]] at Meta-Wiki.

== Inspire Campaign: Improving diversity, improving content ==

This March, we’re organizing an Inspire Campaign to encourage and support new ideas for improving gender diversity on Wikimedia projects. Less than 20% of Wikimedia contributors are women, and many important topics are still missing in our content. We invite all Wikimedians to participate. If you have an idea that could help address this problem, please get involved today! The campaign runs until March 31.

All proposals are welcome - research projects, technical solutions, community organizing and outreach initiatives, or something completely new! Funding is available from the Wikimedia Foundation for projects that need financial support. Constructive, positive feedback on ideas is appreciated, and collaboration is encouraged - your skills and experience may help bring someone else’s project to life. Join us at the Inspire Campaign and help this project better represent the world’s knowledge!

== Feedback request: VisualEditor's special character inserter ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
''I apologize for writing in English.  Please translate this message so that all of your editors can read it.  Thank you!''

Hi everybody, my name is Erica, and I am a Community Liaison at the Wikimedia Foundation. I'm writing to you because the [[:mw:Editing/Team|Editing team at WMF]] wants to know what you think about [[:mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] and its new {{int:visualeditor-specialcharacterinspector-title}} tool.  This change will affect all users on [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|about 50 Wikipedias]], including your Wikipedia.  Many editors at these Wikipedias need a special character tool to be able to write articles correctly, which is why we are asking you now.  

The new special character inserter tool is available in VisualEditor now.  Admins at your wiki can change the contents by following [[:mw:VisualEditor/Special characters|the directions at mediawiki.org]].
[[File:VisualEditor special character inserter March 2015.png|alt=Screenshot from VisualEditor that shows the special character inserter|centre|thumb|800x800px|New design for the special character inserter.  The red arrow points to the button for the tool, which is marked with Ω (omega).]]
'''To test the {{int:visualeditor-specialcharacterinspector-title}}''' tool''', please:'''
# '''Opt-in to VisualEditor''' by going to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures]] and choosing "{{int:visualeditor}}".  Save your preferences.
# '''Edit any article or your user page''' in VisualEditor by clicking on the new "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab at the top of the page. See the [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User guide]] for information on how to use VisualEditor. 
# '''Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested''' at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback#Updated_special_character_inserter_tool_54649|the feedback thread on Mediawiki.org]].  The developers would like to know what you think about this new design.  It is important that they hear from as many editors as possible.   You may leave your comments in any language. 

When the special character tool has been refined a little more based on your thoughts, we will offer VisualEditor by default to all editors at ''this'' wiki.  If you want to help prepare, please read [[mw:Help:VisualEditor/VE_as_the_main_editor|the advice on mediawiki.org]].

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|right|frameless]]
''Hello again. Please excuse the English. I would be grateful if you can translate this message!''

<mark>[[:mw:VisualEditor/Portal|'''VisualEditor''']] is coming to all editors at this Wikipedia on Monday, March 30th.</mark> {{int:visualeditor}} is software that allows people to edit articles without needing to learn wikitext code (like typing <nowiki>[[</nowiki> to start a link). You don't have to wait until the deployment to test it; '''you can test {{int:visualeditor}} right now.''' To turn it on, select [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|"Beta"]] in your preferences. Choose "{{int:visualeditor}}" and click save.

Now, when you press the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" button to edit an article, you will get the new VisualEditor software. To use the wikitext editor, you can press "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}". (After the deployment, everyone will automatically have the option to use either VisualEditor or the current wikitext editor.) For more information about how to use VisualEditor, see [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User guide]]. 

More information about [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/VE_as_the_main_editor|preparing for VisualEditor is posted here]].
* It's easier to add templates if you've added [[:mw:TemplateData|TemplateData]] instructions to them. 
* Please help translate the pages about VisualEditor here and on MediaWiki.org, and its user interface. See [[:mw:VisualEditor/TranslationCentral|VisualEditor TranslationCentral]] for general information. To translate the user guide, go to [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User_guide|the MediaWiki.org page]], and select "{{int:translate-tag-translate-link-desc}}". Your language should be available from the drop-down menu on the right. Once you've done this, you'll see the document in English side by side with any translation work already done in your language. You can add new translations or change old translations.  To translate the user interface, you need to create an account at translatewiki.net. Contact me personally if you need help with that.
* We need your help to improve the software!  Please let us know if you find any problems. You can report issues in [[:phab:|Phabricator, the new bug tracking system]] or on the [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|central feedback page]] on MediaWiki.org. If you notice major issues affecting your project, please leave a note on my talk page.  If it's an emergency (like an unexpected bug causing widespread problems), reach out to James Forrester, the Product Manager, at jforrester@wikimedia.org or on [[:m:IRC|IRC]] in the #mediawiki-visualeditor channel.

Hello again (and again, apologies for using English on this page. Please do translate my message, if you can!).

As some of you have noticed, '''this Wikipedia now has [[:mw:VisualEditor|{{int:visualeditor}}]] (VisualEditor or "VE") enabled for all users'''.  There are now two tabs for editing: "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}". Click "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" to use VisualEditor. Click "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" to edit using wikitext markup.  

All edits using VisualEditor will be tagged with "Tag:{{Int:visualeditor}}" in recent changes, watchlists, and page histories.  To access the [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User guide|User Guide for VisualEditor]], click on the "(?)" icon in VisualEditor's toolbar.  If you wish to disable VisualEditor, this can be done under [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-editing|"Editing" in your preferences]].  

Please report any software "bugs" or errors you find at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|MediaWiki’s VisualEditor Feedback page]].  Translations for the user interface and its help guide are still needed: you can '''learn how to support your community with this and other tasks at [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/VE as the main editor|this instructions page]]'''.

== Stewards confirmation rules ==

Hello, I made [[:m:Requests_for_comment/Confirmation_of_stewards|a proposal on Meta]] to change the rules for the steward confirmations. Currently consensus to remove is required for a steward to lose his status, however I think it's fairer to the community if every steward needed the consensus to keep. As this is an issue that affects all WMF wikis, I'm sending this notification to let people know & be able to participate.

</div></div>
Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has fixed many bugs and worked on VisualEditor's performance, the [[:mw:Citoid|Citoid]] reference service, and support for languages with complex input requirements. Status reports are posted [[:mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on Mediawiki.org]]. The worklist for April through June is available [[phab:project/sprint/board/1113/|in Phabricator]]. 

The weekly '''task triage meetings''' continue to be open to volunteers, each Wednesday at [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20150401T11&p1=224&am=30 11:00 (noon) PDT] (18:00 UTC).  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q4 blocker.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the [[phab:tag/editing_department_2014_15_q4_blockers/|Editing team's Q4 blocker project]] with the bug.  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal|mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal]]. 
=== Recent improvements ===
VisualEditor is now substantially faster.  In many cases, opening the page in VisualEditor is now faster than opening it in the wikitext editor. The new system has improved the code speed by 37% and [[:mw:RESTBase|network speed]] by almost 40%.

The Editing team is slowly adding '''auto-fill features''' '''for citations'''. This is currently available only at the French, Italian, and English Wikipedias.  The '''[[:mw:Citoid|Citoid service]]''' takes a [[:en:URL|URL]] or [[:en:Digital object identifier|DOI]] for a reliable source, and returns a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation. After creating it, you will be able to change or add information to the citation, in the same way that you edit any other pre-existing citation in VisualEditor. Support for [[:en:ISBN|ISBNs]], [[:en:PubMed#PubMed_identifier|PMIDs]], and other identifiers is planned. Later, editors will be able to improve precision and reduce the need for manual corrections by contributing to the Citoid service's definitions for each website.

Citoid requires good [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] for your citation templates.  If you would like to request this feature for your wiki, please post a request in the [[phab:tag/citoid/|Citoid project on Phabricator]]. Include links to the TemplateData for the most important citation templates on your wiki.

The '''special character inserter''' has been improved, based upon feedback from active users.  After this, VisualEditor was made available to all users of Wikipedias on the [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|Phase 5]] list on 30 March.  This affected 53 mid-size and smaller Wikipedias, including '''Afrikaans''', '''Azerbaijani''', '''Breton''', '''Kyrgyz''', '''Macedonian''', '''Mongolian''', '''Tatar''', and''' Welsh'''. 

Work continues to support languages with complex requirements, such as Korean and Japanese.  These languages use [[w:input method editor|input method editors]] ("IMEs”).  Recent improvements to cursoring, backspace, and delete behavior will simplify typing in VisualEditor for these users.

The design for the image selection process is now using a "masonry fit" model.  Images in the search results are displayed at the same height but at variable widths, similar to bricks of different sizes in a masonry wall, or the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:Images#Mode parameter|"packed" mode in image galleries]].  This style helps you find the right image by making it easier to see more details in images.

You can now '''drag and drop categories''' to re-arrange their order of appearance ​on the page.

The pop-up window that appears when you click on a reference, image, link, or other element, is called the "context menu".  It now displays additional useful information, such as the destination of the link or the image's filename.  The team has also added an explicit "Edit" button in the context menu, which helps new editors open the tool to change the item.

'''Invisible templates are marked by a puzzle piece icon''' so they can be interacted with. Users also will be able to see and edit HTML anchors now in section headings.

Users of the TemplateData GUI editor can now set a string as an optional text for the 'deprecated' property in addition to boolean value, which lets you tell users of the template what they should do instead. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T90734 T90734])

=== Looking ahead ===
The special character inserter in VisualEditor will soon use the same special character list as the wikitext editor.  Admins at each wiki will also have the option of creating a custom section for frequently used characters at the top of the list.  Instructions for customizing the list will be posted [[:mw:VisualEditor/Special_characters|at mediawiki.org]].

The team is discussing a test of VisualEditor with new users at the English Wikipedia, to see whether they have met their goals of making VisualEditor suitable for those editors.  The timing is unknown, but might be relatively soon. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T90666 T90666])

== [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Call for candidates|Nominations are being accepted for 2015 Wikimedia Foundation elections]] ==

''This is a message from the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Committee|2015 Wikimedia Foundation Elections Committee]]. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/MassMessages/Accepting nominations|Translations]] are available.''
[[File:Wikimedia Foundation logo - vertical (2012-2016).svg|100px|right]]
Greetings,

I am pleased to announce that nominations are now being accepted for the 2015 Wikimedia Foundation Elections. This year the Board and the FDC Staff are looking for a diverse set of candidates from regions and projects that are traditionally under-represented on the board and in the movement as well as candidates with experience in technology, product or finance. To this end they have [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Call for candidates|published letters]] describing what they think is needed and, recognizing that those who know the community the best are the community themselves, the election committee is [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015|accepting nominations]] for community members you think should run and will reach out to those nominated to provide them with information about the job and the election process.

This year, elections are being held for the following roles:

''Board of Trustees''<br/>
The Board of Trustees is the decision-making body that is ultimately responsible for the long term sustainability of the Foundation, so we value wide input into its selection.  There are three positions being filled. More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/Board elections/2015|the board elections page]].    

''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC)''<br/>
The Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC) makes recommendations about how to allocate Wikimedia movement funds to eligible entities.  There are five positions being filled. More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/FDC elections/2015|the FDC elections page]].

''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC) Ombud''<br/>
The FDC Ombud receives complaints and feedback about the FDC process, investigates complaints at the request of the Board of Trustees,  and summarizes the investigations and feedback for the Board of Trustees on an annual basis.  One position is being filled.  More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/FDC Ombudsperson elections/2015|the FDC Ombudsperson elections page]]. 

The candidacy submission phase lasts from 00:00 UTC April 20 to 23:59 UTC May 5 for the Board and from 00:00 UTCApril 20 to 23:59 UTC April 30 for the FDC and FDC Ombudsperson. This year, we are accepting both self-nominations and nominations of others. More information on this election and the nomination process can be found on [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015|the 2015 Wikimedia elections page on Meta-Wiki]].

Please feel free to post a note about the election on your project's village pump. Any questions related to the election can be posted on the talk page on Meta, or sent to the election committee's mailing list, board-elections -at- wikimedia.org

== Content Translation beta feature is now available ==

Hello, [[mw:Content_translation|Content Translation]] has now been enabled as an opt-in beta feature on this Wikipedia. To start translating, enable the beta feature and go to [[Special:ContentTranslation]] or to your contributions page and create a new translation by selecting the source language, the article name and target language. If the article already exists then a warning will be displayed. After you translate the article, you can publish it directly as a new page on the Wikipedia. In case the article gets created by another user while you  were translating, you will see an option to save the newly published translation under your user namespace. The number of published pages can be seen on the [[Special:CXStats|Content Translation stats page]].

Since, this is the first time we have installed the tool on this Wikipedia, there are chances that there may be some problems or service disruptions which we are not yet aware of. We will be monitoring the usage to check for any failures or issues, but please do let us know on the [[:mw:Talk:Content_translation|Content Translation talk page]] or through [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T99781 Phabricator] if you spot any problems that prevent you from using the tool. For more information, please read [[:mw:Content_translation#Try_the_tool|about how to use the tool]]. You can also view a [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Content_Translation_Screencast_%28English%29.webm short screencast] on how to use Content Translation. My apologies for writing this announcement only in English. Please feel free to translate this message for wider distribution. Thank you. --[[Amseqdac:KartikMistry|KartikMistry]] ([[Amyannan umsqedac:KartikMistry|amyannan]]) 16:46, 21 Mayyu 2015 (UTC)

== Pywikibot compat will no longer be supported - Please migrate to pywikibot core ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
<small>Sorry for English, I hope someone translates this.</small><br />
[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Manual:Pywikibot|Pywikibot]] (then "Pywikipediabot") was started back in 2002. In 2007 a new branch (formerly known as "rewrite", now called "core") was started from scratch using the MediaWiki API. The developers of Pywikibot have decided to stop supporting the compat version of Pywikibot due to bad performance and architectural errors that make it hard to update, compared to core.  If you are using pywikibot compat it is likely your code will break due to upcoming MediaWiki API changes (e.g. [[phab:T101524|T101524]]). It is highly recommended you migrate to the core framework. There is a  [[mw:Manual:Pywikibot/Compat deprecation|migration guide]], and please [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Manual:Pywikibot/Communication|contact us]] if you have any problem.

There is an upcoming MediaWiki API breaking change that compat will not be updated for. If your bot's name is in [https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2015-June/081931.html this list], your bot will most likely break.

== VisualEditor News #3—2015 ==

When you click on a link to an article, you now see more information:
<br><br>
[[File:VisualEditor-context menu-link tool.png|alt=Screenshot showing the link tool's context menu|centre|frameless|230x230px]]
<br>
The link tool has been re-designed:  
<br><br>
[[File:VisualEditor link tool 2015.png|alt=Screenshot of the link inspector|centre|frameless|230x230px]]
<br>
There are separate tabs for linking to internal and external pages.
[[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/User guide|The user guide]] has more information about how to use VisualEditor.
</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has created new interfaces for the link and citation tools and fixed many bugs and changed some elements of the design.  Some of these bugs affected users of VisualEditor on mobile devices. Status reports are posted [[mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on mediawiki.org]]. The worklist for April through June is available [[phab:project/sprint/board/1113/|in Phabricator]]. 

A [[m:Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study|test of VisualEditor's effect on new editors]] at the English Wikipedia has just completed the first phase.  During this test, half of newly registered editors had VisualEditor automatically enabled, and half did not.  The main goal of the study is to learn which group was more likely to save an edit and to make productive, unreverted edits.  Initial [[m:Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study#Results|results will be posted at Meta]] later this month.    
=== Recent improvements ===
'''Auto-fill features''' '''for citations''' are available at a few Wikipedias through the '''[[:mw:Citoid|citoid service]]'''.  Citoid takes a [[:en:URL|URL]] or [[:en:Digital object identifier|DOI]] for a reliable source, and returns a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation.  If Citoid is enabled on your wiki, then the design of the citation workflow changed during May.  All citations are now created inside a single tool.  Inside that tool, choose the tab you want ({{int:citoid-citeFromIDDialog-mode-auto}}, {{int: citoid-citeFromIDDialog-mode-manual}}, or {{int:citoid-citeFromIDDialog-mode-reuse}}).  The cite button is now labeled with the word "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-cite-label}}" rather than a book icon, and the autofill citation dialog now has a more meaningful label, "{{Int:Citoid-citeFromIDDialog-lookup-button}}", for the submit button.

The '''link tool''' has been redesigned based on feedback from Wikipedia editors and user testing.  It now has two separate sections:  one for links to articles and one for external links. When you select a link, its pop-up context menu shows the name of the linked page, a thumbnail image from the linked page, Wikidata's description, and appropriate icons for disambiguation pages, redirect pages and empty pages (where applicable). Search results have been reduced to the first five pages.  Several bugs were fixed, including a dark highlight that appeared over the first match in the link inspector.  ([[phab:T98085|T98085]])

The '''special character inserter''' in VisualEditor now uses the same special character list as the wikitext editor.  Admins at each wiki can also create a custom section for frequently used characters at the top of the list.  Please read the instructions for customizing the list [[mw:VisualEditor/Special_characters|at mediawiki.org]].  Also, there is now a tooltip to describing each character in the special character inserter. ([[phab:T70425|T70425]])

Several improvements have been made to '''templates'''.  When you search for a template to insert, the list of results now contains descriptions of the templates. The parameter list inside the template dialog now remains open after inserting a parameter from the list, so that users don’t need to click on "{{Int:visualeditor-dialog-transclusion-add-param}}" each time they want to add another parameter.  ([[phab:T95696|T95696]]) The team added a '''new property for TemplateData''', "{{int: templatedata-doc-param-example}}", for template parameters.  This optional, translatable property will show up when there is text describing how to use that parameter. ([[phab:T53049|T53049]])

The '''design''' of the main toolbar and several other elements have changed slightly, to be consistent with the MediaWiki theme.  In the Vector skin, individual items in the menu are separated visually by pale gray bars.  Buttons and menus on the toolbar can now contain both an icon and a text label, rather than just one or the other. This new design feature is being used for the cite button on wikis where the Citoid service is enabled.

The team has released a long-desired improvement to the handling of '''non-existent images'''.  If a non-existent image is linked in an article, then it is now visible in VisualEditor and can be selected, edited, replaced, or removed.

=== Let's work together ===
* Share your ideas and ask questions at [https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=VisualEditor/Feedback&lqt_method=talkpage_new_thread mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]. 
* The weekly task triage meetings continue to be open to volunteers, usually on Wednesday at 12:00 (noon) PDT (19:00 UTC).  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q4 blocker, though.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the [[phab:tag/editing_department_2014_15_q4_blockers/|VisualEditor Q4 blocker project]] with the bug.  
* If your Wikivoyage, Wikibooks, Wikiversity, or other community wants to have VisualEditor made available by default to contributors, then please contact [[:m:User:Jdforrester (WMF)|James Forrester]]. 
* If you would like to request the Citoid automatic reference feature for your wiki, please post a request in the [[phab:tag/citoid/|Citoid project on Phabricator]]. Include links to the [[:mw:Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]]  for the most important citation templates on your wiki.

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
Apologies for writing in English.

Hi everyone.

Over the last few years, the Wikimedia Foundation has [http://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/08/01/future-https-wikimedia-projects/ been working] towards enabling [[m:Special:MyLanguage/HTTPS|HTTPS]] by default for all users, including unregistered ones, for better privacy and security for both readers and editors. This has taken a long time, as there were different aspects to take into account. Our servers haven't been ready to handle it. The Wikimedia Foundation has had to balance sometimes conflicting goals.

[https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/ Forced HTTPS] has just been implemented on all Wikimedia projects. Some of you might already be aware of this, as a few Wikipedia language versions were converted to HTTPS last week and the then affected communities were notified.

Most of Wikimedia editors shouldn't be affected at all. If you edit as registered user, you've probably already had to log in through HTTPS.

Apologies for writing in English.

Hi everyone.

Over the last few years, the Wikimedia Foundation has [http://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/08/01/future-https-wikimedia-projects/ been working] towards enabling [[m:Special:MyLanguage/HTTPS|HTTPS]] by default for all users, including unregistered ones, for better privacy and security for both readers and editors. This has taken a long time, as there were different aspects to take into account. Our servers haven't been ready to handle it. The Wikimedia Foundation has had to balance sometimes conflicting goals.

[https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/ Forced HTTPS] has just been implemented on all Wikimedia projects. Some of you might already be aware of this, as a few Wikipedia language versions were converted to HTTPS last week and the then affected communities were notified.

Most of Wikimedia editors shouldn't be affected at all. If you edit as registered user, you've probably already had to log in through HTTPS. We'll keep an eye on this to make sure everything is working as it should. Do get in touch with [[:m:HTTPS#Help!|us]] if you have any problems after this change or contact me if you have any other questions.

== Please join the 2nd edition of the VisualEditor Translathon ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo-pacifico.svg|right|200px]]
Hello! 

I'm pleased to announce the 2nd edition of the '''VisualEditor Translathon'''.

It is a translation rally, focused on interface messages and help pages related to [[:mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]].
In order to participate, you need to '''[[:betawiki:Project:VisualEditor/2015_Translathon|sign up on the Translathon page]]''' on TranslateWiki.

The top 3 contributors will each win a Wikipedia t-shirt of their choice from [//store.wikimedia.org/ the Wikipedia store]<ref>You can choose between any short-sleeve shirt, or other items for the same value.</ref>. 
Translations made between '''July 15th and July 19th''' ([//www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/cdt CDT time zone]) qualify<ref>This means both new translations, and updates for messages in the "Outdated" tab of the translation interface.</ref>. 

If you are at [//wikimania2015.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimania Wikimania Mexico] this year,  you are also welcome to join a related sprint during the hackathon in '''Workplace 1 - Don Américo, Thursday 16 July at 4pm (CDT)''' at the conference venue, so you can meet other fellow translators and [//wikimania2015.wikimedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Hackathon_Day_2 get support if you need some].

Interface messages have the priority. You will need to create an account at translatewiki.net in order to work on them, if you don't have one. ''It is recommended to create the account ASAP'', so that it can be confirmed in time.

You can also help translate documentation pages about VisualEditor on mediawiki.org. You can use your Wikipedia account to work there.

You will find instructions, links and other details [[:betawiki:Project:VisualEditor/2015_Translathon|on the Translathon page]].

Thanks for your attention, and happy translating! <br>

== Wikidata: Access to data from arbitrary items is coming ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
(Sorry for writing in English)

When using data from Wikidata on Wikipedia and other sister projects, there is currently a limitation in place that hinders some use cases: data can only be accessed from the corresponding item. So, for example, the Wikipedia article about Berlin can only get data from the Wikidata item about Berlin but not from the item about Germany. This had technical reasons. We are now removing this limitation. It is already done for many projects. Your project is one of the next ones. We will roll out this feature here on August 12.

We invite you to play around with this new feature if you are one of the people who have been waiting for this for a long time. If you have technical issues/questions with this you can come to [[d:Wikidata:Contact the development team]].

A note of caution: Please be careful with how many items you use for a single page. If it is too many pages, loading might get slow. We will have to see how the feature behaves in production to see where we need to tweak and how.

How to use it, once it is enabled:
* Parser function: <nowiki>{{#property:P36|from=Q183}}</nowiki> to get the capital from the item about Germany
* Lua: see [[mw:Extension:Wikibase Client/Lua]]

Hi everyone,

As I have previously announced here we have now enabled the arbitrary access feature here. This means from now on you can make use of data from any Wikidata item in any article here. Before you could for example only access data about Berlin in the article about Berlin. If you want to find out more or have questions please come to [[d:Wikidata:Arbitrary access]]. I hope this will open up great possibilities for you and make your work easier.

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] have been working on mobile phone support. They have fixed many bugs and improved language support.  They post weekly status reports [[mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on mediawiki.org]]. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  Their [[mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving language support and functionality on mobile devices.   

=== Wikimania ===
The team attended Wikimania 2015 in Mexico City. There they participated in the Hackathon and met with individuals and groups of users. They also made several presentations about [[c:File:How_we_made_VisualEditor_faster.pdf|VisualEditor]] and the [[:c:File:Wikimania_2015_–_Editing_Department_–_Beyond_Editing.pdf|future of editing]]. 

Following Wikimania, we announced winners for the [https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Project:VisualEditor/2015_Translathon VisualEditor 2015 Translathon]. Our thanks and congratulations to users ''Halan-tul'', ''Renessaince'', ''<span lang="ne" dir="ltr">जनक राज भट्ट</span> (Janak Bhatta)'', ''Vahe Gharakhanyan'', ''Warrakkk'', and ''Eduardogobi''.

For '''interface messages''' (translated at [https://translatewiki.net translatewiki.net]), we saw the initiative affecting 42 languages. The average progress in translations across all languages was 56.5% before the translathon, and 78.2% after ('''+21.7%'''). In particular, Sakha improved from 12.2% to 94.2%; Brazilian Portuguese went from 50.6% to 100%; Taraškievica went from 44.9% to 85.3%; Doteli went from 1.3% to 41.2%. Also, while 1.7% of the messages were outdated across all languages before the translathon, the percentage dropped to 0.8% afterwards (-0.9%).   

For '''documentation messages''' (on mediawiki.org), we saw the initiative affecting 24 languages. The average progress in translations across all languages was 26.6% before translathon, and 46.9% after ('''+20.3%''').  There were particularly notable achievements for three languages. Armenian improved from 1% to 99%; Swedish, from 21% to 99%, and Brazilian Portuguese, from 34% to 83%. Outdated translations across all languages were reduced from 8.4% before translathon to 4.8% afterwards (-3.6%).   

[https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Project:VisualEditor/2015_Translathon#Graphs_(interface_messages_only) We published some graphs] showing the effect of the event on the Translathon page. We thank the translators for participating and the translatewiki.net staff for facilitating this initiative.   

=== Recent improvements ===
'''Auto-fill features for citations''' can be enabled on each Wikipedia.  The tool uses the '''[[:mw:Citoid|citoid service]]''' to convert a [[:en:URL|URL]] or [[:en:Digital object identifier|DOI]] into a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation. You can see an animated GIF of the quick, [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/GIFs#Auto-citing_a_source|simple process at mediawiki.org]].  So far, about a dozen Wikipedias have enabled the auto-citation tool.  To enable it for your wiki, follow the [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/Citoid/Enabling_Citoid_on_your_wiki|instructions at mediawiki.org]].

Your wiki can customize the first section of the '''special character inserter''' in VisualEditor. Please follow the [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Special_characters|instructions at mediawiki.org]] to put the characters you want at the top. 
In other changes, if you need to fill in a [[:mw:CAPTCHA|CAPTCHA]] and get it wrong, then you can click to get a new one to complete.  VisualEditor can now display and edit [[mediawikiwiki:Extension:Graph|Vega-based graphs]]. If you use the Monobook skin, VisualEditor's appearance is now more consistent with other software.     

=== Future changes ===
The team will be changing the '''appearance of selected links''' inside VisualEditor. The purpose is to make it easy to see whether your cursor is inside or outside the link.  When you select a link, the link label (the words shown on the page) will be enclosed in a faint box.  If you place your cursor inside the box, then your changes to the link label will be part of the link.  If you place your cursor outside the box, then it will not.  This will make it easy to know when new characters will be added to the link and when they will not.

On the English Wikipedia, 10% of newly created accounts are now offered both the visual and the wikitext editors.  A [[m:Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study|recent controlled trial]] showed no significant difference in survival or productivity for new users in the short term.  New users with access to VisualEditor were very slightly less likely to produce results that needed reverting.  You can learn more about this by watching a video of the [[mediawikiwiki:Wikimedia_Research/Showcase#July_2015|July 2015 Wikimedia Research Showcase]].  The proportion of new accounts with access to both editing environments will be gradually increased over time. Eventually all new users have the choice  between the two editing environments.

=== Let's work together ===
* Share your ideas and ask questions at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]].  This feedback page is now using [[mw:Flow|Flow]] instead of LiquidThreads.
* <mark>Can you read and type in Korean or Japanese?</mark> Language engineer [[mw:User:DChan (WMF)|David Chan]]  needs people who know which tools people use to type in some languages. If you speak Japanese or Korean, you can help him test support for these languages. Please see the instructions at [[mw:VisualEditor/IME Testing#What to test|mediawiki.org]] if you can help.  
* If your wiki would like '''VisualEditor enabled on another namespace''', you can file a request in Phabricator. Please include a link to a community discussion about the requested change.
* Please file requests for language-appropriate "{{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-bold-tooltip}}" and "{{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-italic-tooltip}}" icons for the styling menu [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/create/?projects=PHID-PROJ-dafezmpv6huxg3taml24 in Phabricator].   
* The design research team wants to see how real editors work. Please [https://jfe.qualtrics.com/form/SV_6R04ammTX8uoJFP sign up for their research program]. 
* The weekly task triage meetings continue to be open to volunteers, usually on Tuesdays at 12:00 (noon) PDT (19:00 UTC).  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q1 blocker, though.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the main [[phab:project/profile/483/|VisualEditor project]] with the bug.

'''Did you know?'''  
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 90%;">  

You can use the visual editor on smartphones and tablets.<br><br>[[File:Switching edit modes to VisualEditor on Mobile web.png|alt=Screenshot showing the menu for switching from the wikitext editor to the visual editor|centre|frameless|230x230px]]<br>
Click the pencil icon to open the editor for a page.  Inside that, use the gear menu in the upper right corner to "{{int:mobile-frontend-editor-switch-visual-editor}}".

The editing button will remember which editing environment you used last time, and give you the same one next time.  The desktop site will be switching to a system similar to this one in the coming months.
<br><br>You can read and help translate [[:mw:VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]], which has more information about how to use the visual editor.
</div></div>
Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has fixed many bugs, added new features, and made some small design changes.  They post weekly status reports [[mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on mediawiki.org]]. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  Their [[mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for languages like Japanese and Arabic, making it easier to edit on mobile devices, and providing rich-media tools for formulæ, charts, galleries and uploading.   
=== Recent improvements ===
'''Educational features:''' The first time ever you use the visual editor, it now draws your attention to the {{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-link-tooltip}} and {{Int:visualeditor-toolbar-cite-label}} tools.  When you click on the tools, it explains why you should use them. ([[Phab:T108620|T108620]]) Alongside this, the welcome message for new users has been simplified to make editing more welcoming. ([[Phab:T112354|T112354]])  More in-software educational features are planned.  

'''Links:'''  It is now easier to understand when you are adding text to a link and when you are typing plain text next to it. ([[Phab:T74108|T74108]], [[Phab:T91285|T91285]])  The editor now fully supports ISBN, PMID or RFC numbers. ([[Phab:T109498|T109498]], [[Phab:T110347|T110347]], [[Phab:T63558|T63558]])  These  [[:en:Help:Magic_links|"magic links"]] use a custom link editing tool.  

'''Uploads:'''  Registered editors can now '''upload images''' and other media to Commons while editing.  Click the new tab in the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}} {{int:visualeditor-dialogbutton-media-tooltip}}" tool.  You will be guided through the process without having to leave your edit.  At the end, the image will be inserted. This tool is limited to one file at a time, owned by the user, and licensed under Commons's standard license.  For more complex situations, the tool links to more advanced upload tools.  You can also drag the image into the editor.  This will be available in the wikitext editor later. 

'''Mobile:'''  Previously, the visual editor was available on the mobile Wikipedia site only on tablets. Now, editors can use it on all devices regardless of size if they wish. ([[Phab:T85630|T85630]])  Edit conflicts were previously broken on the mobile website. Edit conflicts can now be resolved in both wikitext and visual editors. ([[Phab:T111894|T111894]])  Sometimes templates and similar items could not be deleted on the mobile website.  Selecting them caused the on-screen keyboard to hide with some browsers.  Now there is a new "{{int:Visualeditor-contextitemwidget-label-remove}}" button, so that these things can be removed if the keyboard hides. ([[Phab:T62110|T62110]]) You can also edit table cells in mobile now.

'''Rich editing tools:'''  You can now add and edit '''sheet''' '''music''' in the visual editor. ([[Phab:T112925|T112925]])  There are separate tabs for advanced options, such as MIDI and Ogg audio files. ([[Phab:T114227|T114227]], [[Phab:T113354|T113354]])  When editing '''formulæ''' and other blocks, errors are shown as you edit.  It is also possible to edit some types of '''graphs'''; adding new ones, and support for new types, will be coming. 

On the '''English Wikipedia''', the visual editor is now automatically available to anyone who creates an account.  The preference switch was moved to the normal location, under [[Special:Preferences]].
=== Future changes ===
You will soon be able to '''switch from the wikitext to the visual editor''' after you start editing. ([[phab:T49779|T49779]]) Previously, you could only switch from the visual editor to the wikitext editor.  Bi-directional switching will make possible a '''single edit tab.''' ([[phab:T102398|T102398]]) This project will combine the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab, similar to the system already used on the mobile website.  The "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab will open whichever editing environment you used last time.

=== Let's work together ===

== Community Wishlist Survey ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"> 

Hi everyone! Apologies for posting in English. Translations are very welcome.

The [[:m:Community Tech|Community Tech team]] at the Wikimedia Foundation is focused on building improved curation and moderation tools for experienced Wikimedia contributors. We're now starting a '''[[:m:2015 Community Wishlist Survey|Community Wishlist Survey]]''' to find the most useful projects that we can work on.

For phase 1 of the survey, we're inviting all active contributors to submit brief proposals, explaining the project that you'd like us to work on, and why it's important. Phase 1 will last for 2 weeks. In phase 2, we'll ask you to vote on the proposals. Afterwards, we'll analyze the top 10 proposals and create a prioritized wishlist.

While most of this process will be conducted in English, we're inviting people from any Wikimedia wiki to submit proposals. We'll also invite volunteer translators to help translate proposals into English. 

Your proposal should include: the problem that you want to solve, who would benefit, and a proposed solution, if you have one. You can submit your proposal on the Community Wishlist Survey page, using the entry field and the big blue button. We will be accepting proposals for 2 weeks, ending on November 23.
 
We're looking forward to hearing your ideas!

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hello! [[wm2016:|Wikimania 2016]] scholarships will soon be open; by the end of the week we'll form the committee and we need your help, see [[wm2016:Special:MyLanguage/Scholarship committee|Scholarship committee]] for details.

If you want to carefully review nearly a thousand applications in January, you might be a perfect committee member. Otherwise, you can '''volunteer as "ambassador"''': you will observe all the committee activities, ensure that people from your language or project manage to apply for a scholarship, translate '''scholarship applications written in your language''' to English and so on. Ambassadors are allowed to ask for a scholarship, unlike committee members.

== [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/MassMessages/2015 Free Bassel banner straw poll|Your input requested on the proposed #FreeBassel banner campaign]] ==

''This is a message regarding the [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner|proposed 2015 Free Bassel banner]]. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/MassMessages/2015 Free Bassel banner straw poll|Translations]] are available.''

Hi everyone,

This is to inform all Wikimedia contributors that a [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner/Straw poll|straw poll seeking your involvement]] has just been started on Meta-Wiki.

As some of your might be aware, a small group of Wikimedia volunteers have proposed a banner campaign informing Wikipedia readers about the urgent situation of our fellow Wikipedian, open source software developer and Creative Commons activist, [[:w:Bassel Khartabil|Bassel Khartabil]]. An exemplary [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner|banner]] and an [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner|explanatory page]] have now been prepared, and translated into about half a dozen languages by volunteer translators.

We are seeking [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner/Straw poll|your involvement to decide]] if the global Wikimedia community approves starting a banner campaign asking Wikipedia readers to call on the Syrian government to release Bassel from prison. We understand that a campaign like this would be unprecedented in Wikipedia's history, which is why we're seeking the widest possible consensus among the community.

Given Bassel's urgent situation and the resulting tight schedule, we ask everyone to [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner/Straw poll|get involved with the poll and the discussion]] to the widest possible extent, and to promote it among your communities as soon as possible.

(Apologies for writing in English; please kindly [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/MassMessages/2015 Free Bassel banner straw poll|translate]] this message into your own language.)

Thank you for your participation!

[[File:International-Space-Station wordmark blue.svg|right|200px]]

As many of you know, January 15 is Wikipedia’s 15th Birthday!

People around the world are getting involved in the celebration and have started adding their [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events|events on Meta Page]]. While we are celebrating Wikipedia's birthday, we hope that all projects and affiliates will be able to utilize this celebration to raise awareness of our community's efforts.

Haven’t started planning? Don’t worry, there’s lots of ways to get involved. Here are some ideas:

* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events|Join/host an event]]'''. We already have more than 80, and hope to have many more.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Media|Talk to local press]]'''. In the past 15 years, Wikipedia has accomplished extraordinary things. We’ve made a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/15 years|handy summary]] of milestones and encourage you to add your own. More resources, including a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Media#releases|press release template]] and [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Communications/Movement Communications Skills|resources on working with the media]], are also available.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Material|Design a Wikipedia 15 logo]]'''. In place of a single icon for Wikipedia 15, we’re making dozens. Add your own with something fun and representative of your community. Just use the visual guide so they share a common sensibility.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events/Package#birthdaywish|Share a message on social media]]'''. Tell the world what Wikipedia means to you, and add #wikipedia15 to the post. We might re-tweet or share your message!

Everything is linked on the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15|Wikipedia 15 Meta page]]. You’ll find a set of ten data visualization works that you can show at your events, and a [[c:Category:Wikipedia15 Mark|list of all the Wikipedia 15 logos]] that community members have already designed.

If you have any questions, please contact [[m:User:ZMcCune (WMF)|Zachary McCune]] or [[m:User:JSutherland (WMF)|Joe Sutherland]].

Thanks and Happy nearly Wikipedia 15!<br />

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|visual editor team]] has fixed many bugs and expanded the mathematics formula tool.  Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  Their [[mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for languages such as Japanese and Arabic, and providing rich-media tools for formulæ, charts, galleries and uploading.   

=== Recent improvements ===
You can '''switch from the wikitext editor to the visual editor''' after you start editing.    
The '''LaTeX mathematics formula editor''' has been significantly expanded. ([[phab:T118616|T118616)]] You can see the formula as you change the LaTeX code.  You can click buttons to insert the correct LaTeX code for many symbols.  
=== Future changes ===
The '''single edit tab''' project will combine the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab, like the system already used on the mobile website.  ([[phab:T102398|T102398]], [[phab:T58337|T58337]])  Initially, the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab will open whichever editing environment you used last time.  Your last editing choice will be stored as a cookie for logged-out users and as an account preference for logged-in editors.  Logged-in editors will be able to set a default editor in the {{int:prefs-editing}} tab of [[Special:Preferences]] in the drop-down menu about "{{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs}}".   

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at the following Wikipedias in early 2016:  [[w:am:|Amharic]], [[w:bug:|Buginese]], [[w:cdo:|Min Dong]], [[w:cr:|Cree]], [[w:gv:|Manx]], [[w:hak:|Hakka]], [[w:hy:|Armenian]], [[w:ka:|Georgian]], [[w:pnt:|Pontic]], [[w:sh:|Serbo-Croatian]], [[w:ti:|Tigrinya]], [[w:xmf:|Mingrelian]], [[w:za:|Zhuang]], and [[w:zh-min-nan:|Min Nan]]. ([[phab:T116523|T116523]]) Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]].  The developers would like to know how well it works.  Please tell them what kind of computer, web browser, and keyboard you are using.  

In 2016, the '''feedback pages''' for the visual editor on many Wikipedias will be redirected to mediawiki.org. ([[phab:T92661|T92661]])

=== Testing opportunities ===
* Please try the new system for the '''single edit tab''' on [https://test2.wikipedia.org test2.wikipedia.org].  You can edit while logged out to see how it works for logged-out editors, or you can create a separate account to be able to set your account's preferences.  <mark>Please share your thoughts about the single edit tab system at [[mediawikiwiki:Topic:Suspcq0bf5nd3gsd|the feedback topic on mediawiki.org]] or [https://jfe.qualtrics.com/form/SV_6R04ammTX8uoJFP sign up for formal user research]</mark> (type "single edit tab" in the question about other areas you're interested in).  The new system has not been finalized, and your feedback can affect the outcome.  The team particularly wants your thoughts about the options in Special:Preferences. The current choices in Special:Preferences are:
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-remember-last}},
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-ve}}, 
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-wt}}, and 
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-multi-tab}}.  (This is the current state for people already using the visual editor.  None of these options will be visible if you have disabled the visual editor in your preferences at that wiki.)

== 2016 WMF Strategy consultation ==

:{{int:Please-translate}}
Hello, all.

The Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) has launched a consultation to help create and prioritize WMF strategy beginning July 2016 and for the 12 to 24 months thereafter. This consultation will be open, on Meta, from 18 January to 26 February, after which the Foundation will also use these ideas to help inform its Annual Plan. (More on our timeline can be found on that Meta page.)

Your input is welcome (and greatly desired) at the Meta discussion, [[:m:2016 Strategy/Community consultation|2016 Strategy/Community consultation]].

Apologies for English, where this is posted on a non-English project. We thought it was more important to get the consultation translated as much as possible, and good headway has been made there in some languages. There is still much to do, however! We created [[:m:2016 Strategy/Translations]] to try to help coordinate what needs translation and what progress is being made. :)

If you have questions, please reach out to me on my talk page or on the strategy consultation's talk page or by email to mdennis@wikimedia.org.

I hope you'll join us! [[:m:User:Mdennis (WMF)|Maggie Dennis]] via [[Amseqdac:MediaWiki message delivery|MediaWiki message delivery]] ([[Amyannan umsqedac:MediaWiki message delivery|amyannan]]) 19:06, 18 yennayer 2016 (UTC)

== Updates to wiki search auto completion are arriving 10 March==

Hello!

{{Int:Please-translate}}. {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}}

The [[:m:User:CKoerner (WMF)/Work/Completion Suggester beta reminder and coming soon|completion suggester beta feature]] will become the default at the first group of wikis on '''Thursday, 10 March'''. This initial rollout will start with some of the smaller wikis to ensure the change happens in an organized way. The remaining wikis will receive the update on Wednesday, 16 March. This update brings three major improvements to search. Improved search result ordering, a tolerance for a small number of spelling errors, and suggests fewer typos.

Since December 2015, 19,000 editors have already opted into the completion suggester beta feature. Contributors are encouraged to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|try out the feature]] ahead of the release. Please share any comments on the Completion Suggester [[mw:Help:CirrusSearch/CompletionSuggester|discussion page]] in any language.

To learn more about the work of the Discovery department and other improvements to search, please check out [[wmfblog:2015/12/23/search-and-discovery-on-wikipedia/|the Wikimedia blog]]. Read about  [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:CirrusSearch|CirrusSearch]], the MediaWiki extension that makes wiki search possible.</div> - [[User:CKoerner (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:CKoerner (WMF)|talk]]) 22:09, 7 meɣres 2016 (UTC)

== Flow, un nouvel outil pour les pages de discussion ==

Bonjour à tous, on aura besoin de l'accord de la communauté de ''Wikipedia s teqbaylit'' pour activer Flow sur ce wiki. Il s'agit d'un nouvel outil qui facilitera les discussions en améliorant la forme des pages de discussion. Voir un exemple sur Wikipédia en français [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipédia:Flow/Bac_à_sable].<br>
Prière de dire si vous êtes d'accord. Réagir en français/anglais sera beaucoup mieux. Tanemmirt, [[Amseqdac:Issimo 15|Issimo 15]] ([[Amyannan umsqedac:Issimo 15|amyannan]]) 18:40, 15 meɣres 2016 (UTC)

Bonjour [[Amseqdac:Issimo 15|Issimo 15]], [[Amseqdac:Buberaga|Buberaga]] et [[Amseqdac:SalemB|SalemB]] ! 

Merci pour votre souhait d'essayer Flow sur votre wiki. Nous discuterons en français vu que vous semblez échanger dans cette langue, si cela ne vous dérange pas (l'anglais me va bien également, le kabyle, hélas, m'échappe totalement). 

Sur quelles pages souhaitez-vous utiliser Flow ? Si c'est sur juste une page, je peux vous faire cela de suite. Si vous souhaitez que chacun puisse activer Flow sur sa page utilisateur ou que toutes les pages de discussion soient converties à Flow, il nous faudra un peu plus de temps. Dites-moi ce que vous préférez.

Je peux d'ores et déjà activer Flow sur [[Wikipedia:Agraw]].

Bonne journée, [[Amseqdac:Trizek (WMF)|Trizek (WMF)]] ([[Amyannan umsqedac:Trizek (WMF)|amyannan]]) 11:51, 6 Yebrir 2016 (UTC)

Je vous contacte pour avoir plus d'informations sur ce que vous avez décidé concernant L'utilisation de Flow. Trois cas sont possibles : 
# souhaitez-vous que Flow soit déployé sur les pages de discussion des utilisateurs qui en font la demande (cas actuel) ? 
# souhaitez vous que Flow soit déployé sur les pages de discussion des utilisateurs qui le souhaitent ([[Uslig:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|fonctionnalité ''Beta']]', vous êtes libres d'activer/désactiver) ? 
# souhaitez-vous que Flow soit déployé sur toutes les pages de discussion de ce wiki comme option par défaut (vous avez Flow quand vous créez la page) ? 

En l'absence de plusieurs réponses, je resterai à l'option 1.

== Server switch 2016 ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its newest data center in Dallas.
This will make sure Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.
To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to conduct a planned test.  This test will show whether they can reliably switch from one data center to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems.

They will switch all traffic to the new data center on '''Tuesday, 19 April'''.<br/>
On '''Thursday, 21 April''', they will switch back to the primary data center.

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop during those two switches.
We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future.

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for approximately 15 to 30 minutes on Tuesday, 19 April and Thursday, 21 April, starting at 14:00 UTC (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT).

If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.
We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.
If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.
Then you should be able to save your edit.
But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped.
Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal.
If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual.
Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be a code freeze for the week of 18 April.
No non-essential code deployments will take place.

This test was originally planned to take place on March 22.
April 19th and 21st are the new dates. 
You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for Q3 FY2015-2016 rollout|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]].
They will post any changes on that schedule.
There will be more notifications about this.

Three weeks ago, you were invited to vote on how to take Wikipedia articles to the Moon. Community voting is over and the winning idea is to send all ‘’featured articles and lists’’ to the Moon. This decision means that, starting today, Wikipedians from all language communities are warmly invited to intensively work on their best articles and lists, and submit them to Wikipedia to the Moon. The central site to coordinate between communities will be Meta-Wiki. You will find an [[m:Wikipedia to the Moon/Working|overview and more information there]]. Hopefully, we will be able to represent as many languages as possible, to show Wikipedia’s diversity.

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has fixed many bugs. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]]. Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for Arabic and Indic scripts, and adapting the visual editor to the needs of the Wikivoyages and Wikisources.   

=== Recent changes ===
The visual editor is now available to all users at most [[Wikivoyage:|Wikivoyages]].  It was also enabled for all contributors at the French Wikinews.

The '''[[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Single edit tab|single edit tab]]''' feature combines the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab.  It has been deployed to several Wikipedias, including Hungarian, Polish, English and Japanese Wikipedias, as well as to all Wikivoyages.  At these wikis, you can change your settings for this feature in the "{{int:prefs-editing}}" tab of [[Special:Preferences]]. The team is now reviewing the feedback and considering ways to improve the design before rolling it out to more people.

=== Future changes ===
The "{{int:Savearticle}}" button will say "{{int:Publishpage}}".   This will affect both the visual and wikitext editing systems.  More [[M:Editing/Publish|information is available on Meta]].

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at the remaining [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|"Phase 6" Wikipedias]] during the next few months. The developers want to know whether typing in your language feels natural in the visual editor. Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]]. This will affect several languages, including: [[:w:ar: |'''Arabic''']], [[:w:hi: |'''Hindi''']], [[:w:th: |'''Thai''']], [[:w:ta: |'''Tamil''']], [[:w:mr: |'''Marathi''']], [[:w:ml: |'''Malayalam''']], [[:w:ur: |'''Urdu''']], [[:w:fa: |'''Persian''']], [[:w:bn: |'''Bengali''']], [[:w:as: |'''Assamese''']], [[:w:arc: |'''Aramaic''']] and others.

The team is working with the volunteer developers who power Wikisource to provide the visual editor there, for opt-in testing right now and eventually for all users. ([[phab:T138966|T138966]]) 

The team is working on a modern wikitext editor.  It will look like the visual editor, and be able to use the citoid service and other modern tools.  This new editing system may become available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices around September 2016.  You can read about this project in a [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Roadmap/Update_2016-06-23|general status update on the Wikimedia mailing list]]. 

=== Let's work together ===
* Do you teach new editors how to use the visual editor? Did you help [[:mw:Citoid/Enabling Citoid on your wiki|set up the Citoid automatic reference feature for your wiki]]? Have you written or imported [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] for your most important citation templates?  <mark>Would you be willing to help new editors and small communities with the visual editor?  Please sign up for the new [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/Community Taskforce|'''VisualEditor Community Taskforce''']].</mark>
* Learn how to improve the "automagical" [[:mw:citoid|citoid]] referencing system in the visual editor, by creating [[w:en:Zotero|Zotero]] translators for popular sources in your language!  Watch the [[Mw:Citoid/Zotero's Tech Talk|Tech Talk by Sebastian Karcher]] for more information.

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has mainly worked on a new wikitext editor.  They have also released some small features and the new map editing tool.  Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  You can find links to the list of work finished each week at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are fixing bugs, releasing the 2017 wikitext editor as a [[mediawikiwiki:Beta_Features|beta feature]], and improving language support.

=== Recent changes ===

*You can now set text as small or big.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T53613] 
*Invisible templates have been shown as a puzzle icon.  Now, the name of the invisible template is displayed next to the puzzle icon.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T141861]  A similar feature will display the first part of hidden HTML comments.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T147089]
*Categories are displayed at the bottom of each page.  If you click on the categories, the dialog for editing categories will open.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T145267]
*At many wikis, you can now add [[mediawikiwiki:Maps|maps]] to pages.  Go to the Insert menu and choose the "Maps" item. The Discovery department is adding more features to this area, like geoshapes. You can read more at mediawiki.org.[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Discovery#Maps]
*The "Save" button now says "Save page" when you create a page, and "Save changes" when you change an existing page.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T139033]  In the future, the "{{int:Savearticle}}" button will say "{{int:Publishpage}}".  This will affect both the visual and wikitext editing systems.  More [[:m:Editing/Publish|information is available on Meta]].
*Image galleries now use a visual mode for editing.  You can see thumbnails of the images, add new files, remove unwanted images, rearrange the images by dragging and dropping, and add captions for each image.  Use the "Options" tab to set the gallery's display mode, image sizes, and add a title for the gallery.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T45037]

*A '''new wikitext editing mode''' is available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices.  The [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor|2017 wikitext editor]] has the same toolbar as the visual editor and can use the citoid service and other modern tools.

More features will be added to this later.  In the future, this tool may be integrated into other MediaWiki components. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T143350]
* The team have added [[:mediawikiwiki:Editing/Projects/Columns_for_references|multi-column support for lists of footnotes]]. The <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code> block can automatically display long lists of references in columns on wide screens.  This makes footnotes easier to read.

[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T33597]
* You can now use your web browser's function to switch typing direction in the new wikitext mode. This is particularly helpful for RTL language users like Urdu or Hebrew who have to write JavaScript or CSS. You can use Command+Shift+X or Control+Shift+X to trigger this. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153356]
* The way to switch between the visual editing mode and the wikitext editing mode is now consistent. There is a drop-down menu that shows the two options. This is now the same in desktop and mobile web editing, and inside things that embed editing, such as Flow. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T116417]

* There is a new keyboard shortcut for citations:  <code>Control</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a PC, or <code>Command</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a Mac.  It is based on the keyboard shortcut for making links, which is <code>Control</code>+<code>K</code> or <code>Command</code>+<code>K</code> respectively. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T99299]

=== Future changes ===
* The team is working on a syntax highlighting tool.  It will highlight matching pairs of <code><nowiki><ref></nowiki></code> tags and other types of wikitext syntax.  You will be able to turn it on and off.  It will first become available in VisualEditor's built-in wikitext mode, maybe late in 2017. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T101246]
* The kind of button used to {{Int:Showpreview}}, {{Int:showdiff}}, and finish an edit will change in all WMF-supported wikitext editors.  The new buttons will use [[Mw:OOjs UI|OOjs UI]].  The buttons will be larger, brighter, and easier to read.  The labels will remain the same.  You can test the new button by editing a page and adding <code>&ooui=1</code> to the end of the URL, like this:  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Sandbox?action=edit&ooui=1  The old appearance will no longer be possible, even with local CSS changes.  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T162849]

== Prototype for editing Wikidata infoboxes on Wikipedia ==

Hello,

I’m sorry for writing in English. It’d be great if someone could translate this message if necessary.

One of the most requested features for Wikidata is to enable editing of Wikidata’s data directly from Wikipedia, so the editors can continue their workflow without switching websites.

The Wikidata development team has been working on a tool to achieve this goal: '''fill and edit the Wikipedia infoboxes with information from Wikidata, directly on Wikipedia''', via the Visual Editor. 

We already [[d:Wikidata:Client editing input|asked for feedback in 2015]], and collected some interesting ideas which we [[:File:Facilitating_the_use_of_Wikidata_in_Wikimedia_projects_with_a_user-centered_design_approach.pdf|shared with you in this thesis]]. Now we would like to present to you our first prototype and collect your feedback, in order to improve and continue the development of this feature.

We present this work to you very early, so we can include your feedback before and all along the development. You are the core users of this feature, so we want to make sure that it fits your needs and editing processes.

You will find the prototype, description of the features, and a demo video, '''[[d:Special:MyLanguage/Wikidata:Client editing prototype|on this page]]'''. Feel free to add any comment or feedback on the talk page. The page is currently not translated in every languages, but you can add your contribution by helping to translate it.

Unfortunately, I won’t be able to follow all the discussions on Wikipedia, so if you want to be sure that your feedback is read, please add it on the Wikidata page, in your favorite language. Thanks for your understanding.

Thanks, [[user:Lea Lacroix (WMDE)|Lea Lacroix (WMDE)]]

[[File:Wikitext diff paragraph move correcting vandalism 2018.png|alt=Screenshot showing some changes, in the two-column wikitext diff display|center|frameless|250px]]

Sometimes, it is hard to see important changes in a wikitext diff.  This screenshot of a wikitext diff (click to enlarge) shows that the paragraphs have been rearranged, but it does not highlight the removal of a word or the addition of a new sentence.

If you [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|enable the Beta Feature]] for "{{Int:visualeditor-preference-visualdiffpage-label}}", you will have a new option.  It will give you a new box at the top of every diff page.  This box will let you choose either diff system on any edit.

[[File:VisualEditor visual diff tool - toggle button.png|alt=Toggle button showing visual and wikitext options; visual option is selected|center|frameless|200px]]
Click the toggle button to switch between visual and wikitext diffs.

In the visual diff, additions, removals, new links, and formatting changes will be highlighted.  Other changes, such as changing the size of an image, are described in notes on the side.

[[File:Visual diff paragraph move correcting vandalism 2018.png|alt=Screenshot showing the same changes to an article.  Most changes are highlighted with text formatting.|center|frameless|250px]]

This screenshot shows the same edit as the wikitext diff.  The visual diff highlights the removal of one word and the addition of a new sentence.

You can read and help translate [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]], which has more information about how to use the visual editor.

Since [[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2017/May|the last newsletter]], the [[mw:Editing|Editing Team]] has spent most of their time supporting [[mw:2017 wikitext editor|the 2017 wikitext editor mode]], which is available inside the visual editor as a Beta Feature, and improving [[mw:VisualEditor/Diffs|the visual diff tool]]. Their work board is available [[phab:project/view/3236/|in Phabricator]].  You can find links to the work finished each week at [[mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  Their [[mw:Editing team/Current priorities|current priorities]] are fixing bugs, supporting the 2017 wikitext editor, and improving the visual diff tool.
===Recent changes===
*The '''[[mw:2017 wikitext editor|2017 wikitext editor]]''' is [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|available as a Beta Feature]] on desktop devices.  It has the same toolbar as the visual editor and can use the citoid service and other modern tools.  The team have been comparing the performance of different editing environments.  They have studied how long it takes to open the page and start typing.  The study uses data for more than one million edits during December and January.  Some changes have been made to improve the speed of the 2017 wikitext editor and the visual editor.  Recently, the 2017 wikitext editor opened fastest for most edits, and the 2010 WikiEditor was fastest for some edits.  More information will be posted at [[mw:Contributors/Projects/Editing performance]].
*The '''[[mw:VisualEditor/Diffs|visual diff tool]]''' was developed for the visual editor.  It is now available to all users of the visual editor and the 2017 wikitext editor.  When you review your changes, you can toggle between wikitext and visual diffs.  You can also [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|enable the new Beta Feature]] for "Visual diffs".  The Beta Feature lets you use the visual diff tool to view other people's edits on page histories and [[Special:RecentChanges]].  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T167508]
*[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:CodeMirror|'''Wikitext syntax highlighting''']] is available as a Beta Feature for both [[mw:2017 wikitext editor|the 2017 wikitext editor]] and the 2010 wikitext editor. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T101246]
*The [[mw:Citoid|citoid service]] automatically translates URLs, DOIs, ISBNs, and PubMed id numbers into wikitext citation templates.  It is very popular and useful to editors, although it can be a bit tricky to set up.  <mark>Your wiki can have this service.  Please [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Citoid/Enabling Citoid on your wiki|read the instructions]]. You can [[phab:T127354|ask the team to help you enable citoid at your wiki]]</mark>.

===Let's work together===
*The team will talk about editing tools at an upcoming [[m:Wikimedia Foundation metrics and activities meetings|Wikimedia Foundation metrics and activities meeting]].
*Wikibooks, Wikiversity, and other communities may have the visual editor made available by default to contributors.  If your community wants this, then please contact [[mw:User talk:Deskana (WMF)|Dan Garry]].
*The <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code> block can [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Contributors/Projects/Columns for references|automatically display long lists of references in columns]] on wide screens.  This makes footnotes easier to read.

Welcome back to the [[mw:Editing|Editing]] newsletter.

Since [[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2018/October|the last newsletter]], the team has released two new features for the [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|mobile visual editor]] and has started developing three more.  All of this work is part of the team's goal to [[m:Wikimedia Foundation Annual Plan/2018-2019/Audiences#Outcome 3: Mobile Contribution|make editing on mobile web simpler]].  

Before talking about the team's recent releases, we have a question for you:  

<strong>Are you willing to try a new way to add and change links?</strong>

If you are interested, we would value your input!  You can try this new link tool in the mobile visual editor on a separate wiki. 

<em>Follow these instructions and share your experience:</em>

<strong>[[mw:Topic:V394zwrigth8ii7c|📲 Try Edit Cards]].</strong>

=== Recent releases ===
The mobile visual editor is a simpler editing tool, for smartphones and tablets using the [[mw:Reading/Web/Mobile#About|mobile site]].  The Editing team recently launched two new features to improve the mobile visual editor: 

# [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Section editing|Section editing]]
#* The purpose is to help contributors focus on their edits.
#* The team studied this with an A/B test.  [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Section editing#16 June 2019|This test showed]] that contributors who could use section editing were '''1% more likely to publish''' the edits they started than people with only full-page editing.
# [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile#March 1, 2019|Loading overlay]]
#* The purpose is to smooth the transition between reading and editing.

Section editing and the new loading overlay are '''now available to everyone''' using the mobile visual editor.

=== New and active projects ===
This is a list of our most active projects. [[mw:Help:Watching pages|Watch]] these pages to learn about project updates and to share your input on new designs, prototypes and research findings.

*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Edit cards|Edit cards]]: This is a clearer way to add and edit links, citations, images, templates, etc. in articles.  You can try this feature now.  <em>Go here to see how:</em> [[mw:Topic:V394zwrigth8ii7c|📲 <em>Try Edit Cards</em>]].
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Toolbar refresh|Mobile toolbar refresh]]: This project will learn if contributors are more successful when the editing tools are easier to recognize.
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/VE mobile default|Mobile visual editor availability]]: This A/B test asks:  ''Are newer contributors more successful if they use the mobile visual editor?''  We are collaborating with [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/VE mobile default#26 June 2019 %E2%80%93 Participating wikis and test start date|20 Wikipedias]] to answer this question.
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Usability improvements|Usability improvements]]: This project will make the mobile visual editor easier to use.  The goal is to let contributors stay focused on editing and to feel more confident in the editing tools.

=== Looking ahead ===

* '''Wikimania:'''  Several members of the Editing Team will be attending [[wmania:|Wikimania]] in August 2019.  They will lead a session about mobile editing in the [[wmania:2019:Community Growth/Visual editing on mobile: An accessible editor for all|Community Growth space]].  Talk to the team about how editing can be improved.
* '''Talk Pages:'''  In the coming months, the Editing Team will begin [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|improving talk pages]] and communication on the wikis.

=== Learning more ===
The [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|VisualEditor on mobile]] is a good place to learn more about the projects we are working on. The team wants to talk with you about anything related to editing.

Inside this newsletter, the [[mw:Editing|Editing team]] talks about their work on the [[mw:Mobile visual editor|mobile visual editor]], on [[mw:Talk pages project|the new talk pages project]], and at [[wikimania:|Wikimania 2019]].

=== Help ===
<strong>What talk page interactions do you remember?</strong> Is it a story about how someone helped you to learn something new? Is it a story about how someone helped you get involved in a group? Something else?  Whatever your story is, we want to hear it!  

Please tell us a story about how you used a talk page.  <mark>Please share a link to a memorable discussion, or describe it on the <strong>[[mw:Topic:V8d91yh8gcg404dj|talk page for this project]]</strong>.</mark>  The team wants your examples.  These examples will help everyone develop a shared understanding of what this project should support and encourage.

=== Talk pages project ===
The [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|Talk Pages Consultation]] was a global consultation to define better tools for wiki communication. From February through June 2019, more than 500 volunteers on 20 wikis, across 15 languages and multiple projects, came together with members of the Foundation to create a product direction for a set of discussion tools.  The [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Phase 2 report|Phase 2 Report]] of the Talk Page Consultation was published in August. It summarizes the product direction the team has started to work on, which you can read more about here: [[mw:Talk pages project|Talk Page Project project page]]. 

The team needs and wants your help at this early stage.  They are starting to develop the first idea. Please add your name to the [[mw:Talk pages project#Getting involved|<strong>"Getting involved"</strong>]] section of the project page, if you would like to hear about opportunities to participate.

=== Mobile visual editor ===

[[File:Wikimania logo with text 2.svg|right|200px]]
Dear all,

Wikimania 2021 will be [[:wikimania:2021:Save the date and the Core Organizing Team|hosted virtually]] for the first time in the event's 15-year history. Since there is no in-person host, the event is being organized by a diverse group of Wikimedia volunteers that form the [[:wikimania:2021:Organizers|Core Organizing Team]] (COT) for Wikimania 2021.

'''Event Program''' - Individuals or a group of individuals can submit their session proposals to be a part of the program. There will be translation support for sessions provided in a number of languages. See more information [[:wikimania:2021:Submissions/Guidelines#Language Accessibility|here]].

Below are some links to guide you through;
* [[:wikimania:2021:Submissions|Program Submissions]]
* [[:wikimania:2021:Submissions/Guidelines|Session Submission Guidelines]]
* [[:wikimania:2021:FAQ|FAQ]]

Please note that the deadline for submission is 18th June 2021. 

'''Announcements'''- To keep up to date with the developments around Wikimania, the COT sends out weekly updates. You can view them in the Announcement section [[:wikimania:2021:Announcements|here]]. 

'''Office Hour''' - If you are left with questions, the COT will be hosting some office hours (in multiple languages), in multiple time-zones, to answer any programming questions that you might have.  Details can be found [[:wikimania:2021:Organizers#Office hours schedule|here.]]

[[File:Reply Tool A-B test comment completion.png|alt=Junior contributors comment completion rate across all participating Wikipedias|thumb|296x296px|When newcomers had the Reply tool and tried to post on a talk page, they were more successful at posting a comment. ([https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ Source])]]

Earlier this year, the Editing team ran a large study of [[mw:Talk pages project/Replying|the Reply Tool]].  The main goal was to find out whether the Reply Tool helped [[mw:Talk pages project/Glossary|newer editors]] communicate on wiki.  The second goal was to see whether the comments that newer editors made using the tool needed to be reverted more frequently than comments newer editors made with the existing wikitext page editor.

The key results were:

* Newer editors who had automatic ("default on") access to the Reply tool were [https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ more likely] to post a comment on a talk page.
* The comments that newer editors made with the Reply Tool were also [https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ less likely] to be reverted than the comments that newer editors made with page editing.

These results give the Editing team confidence that the tool is helpful.

<strong>Looking ahead</strong>

The team is planning to make the Reply tool available to everyone as an opt-out preference in the coming months.  This has already happened at the Arabic, Czech, and Hungarian Wikipedias.

The next step is to [[phab:T280599|resolve a technical challenge]]. Then, they will deploy the Reply tool first to the [[phab:T267379|Wikipedias that participated in the study]].  After that, they will deploy it, in stages, to the other Wikipedias and all WMF-hosted wikis.

You can turn on "{{int:discussiontools-preference-label}}" [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|in Beta Features]] now.  After you get the Reply tool, you can change your preferences at any time in [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-editing-discussion]].
