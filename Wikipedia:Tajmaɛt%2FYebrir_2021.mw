=== Universal Code of Conduct Phase 2 ===

{{int:please-translate}}

The [[:wmf:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct|'''Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC)''']] provides a universal baseline of acceptable behavior for the entire Wikimedia movement and all its projects. The project is currently in Phase 2, outlining clear enforcement pathways. You can read more about the whole project on its [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct|'''project page''']].

==== Drafting Committee: Call for applications ====

The Wikimedia Foundation is recruiting volunteers to join a committee to draft how to make the code enforceable. Volunteers on the committee will commit between 2 and 6 hours per week from late April through July and again in October and November. It is important that the committee be diverse and inclusive, and have a range of experiences, including both experienced users and newcomers, and those who have received or responded to, as well as those who have been falsely accused of harassment.

To apply and learn more about the process, see [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee|Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee]].

==== 2021 community consultations: Notice and call for volunteers / translators ====

From 5 April – 5 May 2021 there will be conversations on many Wikimedia projects about how to enforce the UCoC. We are looking for volunteers to translate key material, as well as to help host consultations on their own languages or projects using suggested [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations/Discussion|key questions]]. If you are interested in volunteering for either of these roles, please [[:m:Talk:Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations|contact us]] in whatever language you are most comfortable.

To learn more about this work and other conversations taking place, see [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations|Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations]].

== Global bot policy changes ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
{{int:hello}}!

I apologize for sending a message in English. {{int:please-translate}}. According to [[:m:Bot_policy/Implementation#Where_it_is_policy|the list]], your wiki project is currently opted in to the [[:m:Bot_policy#Global_bots|global bot policy]]. As such, I want to let you know about some changes that were made after the [[:m:Requests for comment/Refine global bot policy|global RfC]] was closed.

*Global bots are now subject to a 2 week discussion, and it'll be publicized via a MassMessage list, available at [[:m:Bot policy/New global bot discussion|Bot policy/New global bot discussion]] on Meta. Please subscribe yourself or your wiki if you are interested in new global bots proposals.
*For a bot to be considered for approval, it must demonstrate it is welcomed in multiple projects, and a good way to do that is to have the bot flag on at least 5 wikis for a single task.
*The bot operator should make sure to adhere to the wiki's preference as related to the use of the bot flag (i.e., if a wiki doesn't want a bot to use the flag as it edits, that should be followed).

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,<br />

== Line numbering coming soon to all wikis ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">  

[[File:Technical_Wishes_–_Line_numbering_-_2010_wikitext_editor.png|thumb|Example]]
From April 15, you can enable line numbering in some wikitext editors - for now in the template namespace, coming to more namespaces soon. This will make it easier to detect line breaks and to refer to a particular line in discussions. These numbers will be shown if you enable the syntax highlighting feature ([[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:CodeMirror|CodeMirror extension]]), which is supported in the [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:WikiEditor|2010]] and [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/2017 wikitext editor|2017]] wikitext editors. 

More information can be found on [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes/Line Numbering|this project page]]. Everyone is invited to test the feature, and to give feedback [[m:talk:WMDE Technical Wishes/Line Numbering|on this talk page]].

== Suggested Values ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">  

From April 29, it will be possible to suggest values for parameters in templates. Suggested values can be added to [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] and will then be shown as a drop-down list in [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:VisualEditor/User guide|VisualEditor]]. This allows template users to quickly select an appropriate value. This way, it prevents potential errors and reduces the effort needed to fill the template with values. It will still be possible to fill in values other than the suggested ones.

More information, including the supported parameter types and how to create suggested values: [[mw:Help:TemplateData#suggestedvalues|[1]]] [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Suggested_values_for_template_parameters|[2]]]. Everyone is invited to test the feature, and to give feedback [[m:Talk:WMDE Technical Wishes/Suggested values for template parameters|on this talk page]].
