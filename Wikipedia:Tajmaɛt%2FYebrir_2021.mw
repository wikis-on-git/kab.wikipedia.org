=== Universal Code of Conduct Phase 2 ===

{{int:please-translate}}

The [[:wmf:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct|'''Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC)''']] provides a universal baseline of acceptable behavior for the entire Wikimedia movement and all its projects. The project is currently in Phase 2, outlining clear enforcement pathways. You can read more about the whole project on its [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct|'''project page''']].

==== Drafting Committee: Call for applications ====

The Wikimedia Foundation is recruiting volunteers to join a committee to draft how to make the code enforceable. Volunteers on the committee will commit between 2 and 6 hours per week from late April through July and again in October and November. It is important that the committee be diverse and inclusive, and have a range of experiences, including both experienced users and newcomers, and those who have received or responded to, as well as those who have been falsely accused of harassment.

To apply and learn more about the process, see [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee|Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee]].

==== 2021 community consultations: Notice and call for volunteers / translators ====

From 5 April – 5 May 2021 there will be conversations on many Wikimedia projects about how to enforce the UCoC. We are looking for volunteers to translate key material, as well as to help host consultations on their own languages or projects using suggested [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations/Discussion|key questions]]. If you are interested in volunteering for either of these roles, please [[:m:Talk:Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations|contact us]] in whatever language you are most comfortable.

To learn more about this work and other conversations taking place, see [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations|Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations]].
