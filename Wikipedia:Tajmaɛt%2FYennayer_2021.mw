== Project Grant Open Call ==

This is the announcement for the [[m:Grants:Project|Project Grants program]] open call that started on January 11, with the submission deadline of February 10, 2021.<br> This first open call will be focussed on Community Organizing proposals. A second open call focused on research and software proposals is scheduled from February 15 with a submission deadline of March 16, 2021.<br>

For the Round 1 open call, we invite you to propose grant applications that fall under community development and organizing (offline and online) categories. Project Grant funds are available to support individuals, groups, and organizations to implement new experiments and proven ideas, from organizing a better process on your wiki, coordinating a campaign or editathon series to providing other support for community building.  We offer the following resources to help you plan your project and complete a grant proposal:<br>

* Weekly proposals clinics via Zoom during the Open Call. Join us for [[m:Grants:Project|#Upcoming_Proposal_Clinics|real-time discussions]] with Program Officers and select thematic experts and get live feedback about your Project Grants proposal. We’ll answer questions and help you make your proposal better. We also offer these support pages to help you build your proposal:
* [[m:Grants:Project/Tutorial|Video tutorials]] for writing a strong application<br>
* General [[m:Grants:Project/Plan|planning page]] for Project Grants <br>
* [[m:Grants:Project/Learn|Program guidelines and criteria]]<br>

Program officers are also available to offer individualized proposal support upon request. Contact us if you would like feedback or more information.<br>

We are excited to see your grant ideas that will support our community and make an impact on the future of Wikimedia projects. Put your idea into motion, and [[m:Grants:Project/Apply|submit your proposal]] by February 10, 2021!<br>
