== Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees election has come to an end ==

Thank you for participating in the [[:meta:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2021|2021 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees election]]! Voting closed August 31 at 23:59. The official data, including the four most voted candidates, will be announced as soon as the [[:meta:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections_committee|Elections Committee]] completes their review of the ballots. The official announcement of the new trustees appointed will happen later, once the selected candidates have been confirmed by the Board.

6,946 community members from 216 wiki projects have voted. This makes 10.2% global participation, 1.1% higher than in the last Board elections. In 2017, 5167 people from 202 wiki projects cast their vote. A full analysis is planned to be published in a few days when the confirmed results are announced. In the meantime, you can check the [[:meta:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2021/Stats|data produced during the election]].

Diversity was an important goal with these elections. Messages about the Board election were translated into 61 languages. This outreach worked well. There were 70 communities with eligible voters voting in this election for the first time. With your help, next year’s Board of Trustees election will be even better.
